# Stock-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analyis was to provide Steve the ability to do a little more stock research for his parents, he needed to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. To aid him in this endeavor I created a VBA script to analyze the stock market in 2017 and 2018 to provide some insight as to whichj securities would work best.
## Results 
The analysis of 2017 and 2018 provided only two viable candidates for Steve to invest in: ENPH and RUN.
As we can see, 2017 saw many stocks post impressive gains, many well above 100%

However, many of those gains were erased in 2018 as only two stocks, ENPH and RUN, continued to post gains while many reversed portions of their previouse year's returns.

## Summary
### advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code
The Refactored code was greatly streamlined and provided ease of access and assessment. However, the compex nature of refactored code lends itself to errors in executions
### advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script
The main advantage of the original VBA script was its simplicity in design, allowing for an easier assessment of error locations. However, due to this simplicity it takes far too long to compose and execute.
